# This yaml file creates the kickstarts for the SDK images
#
# It produces ks files that work against both the final released
# version of the Tools project and against the OBS repository.  This
# provides confidence that a release built against the final release
# will behave consistently with an OBS trial build.
#
# It currently makes use of the BUILD_ID to define which Mer release
# to use and the target Tools release is hardcoded
#
# Ideally kickstarter will be extended to support multiple 'defines'
# such as MER_RELEASE and TOOLS_RELEASE
